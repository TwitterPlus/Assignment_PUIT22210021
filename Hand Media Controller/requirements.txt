# Notes:
# - `mediapipe`, `opencv-python`, and `numpy` provide the hand-tracking and image processing.
# - `pyautogui` is used to send media/volume key presses (Pillow is a runtime dependency).
# - `pycaw` and `comtypes` are optional and only needed if you plan to use Windows Audio APIs
#   (the script currently keeps the pycaw imports for reference).
